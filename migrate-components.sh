# List of components to extract

echo "🔧 Next Steps:"
echo "1. Open views.js and locate each component"
echo "2. Copy the component to its respective file in components/views/"
echo "3. Update the component to use proper key props"
echo "4. Test the application to ensure it works"
echo "5. Update index.html to include the new component files"
echo ""
echo "💡 Tips:"
echo "- Use search in your editor to find component definitions"
echo "- Look for patterns like '${component_name}: ({'"
echo "- Make sure to include all dependencies and imports"
echo "- Test each component individually before moving to the next"

echo "🎯 Current Status:"
echo "✅ All View Components - Completed"
echo "   - POSView.js, LoyaltyView.js, InventoryView.js, SalesView.js, SettingsView.js"
echo "✅ Common Components - Completed"
echo "   - TabButton.js, CategoryBadge.js"
echo "⏳ Modal Components - Pending (in modals.js - 1596 lines)"
echo "⏳ Card Components - Pending (embedded in views)"
